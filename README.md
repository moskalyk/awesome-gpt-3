An awesome list of gpt-3 experiments + outputted newsletter. Find it here: https://deep6.substack.com/p/coming-soon

Protoype: New interaction affordances for simulation detection i.e. knowledge, wisdom, etc. Goal: Reveal new structure in dialogue experiements to discern more actionable insight for new vistas & surfaces. Counter: Optical language flow funnelled attention into techno-slavery. Approach: Learning a path in a sequence of transitions via timely newsletter. Analog: Curated twitter account following and feed consumption.

Action Space:

- Discrete Thoughts (e.g. tweet)
- Create Pull Request

- [Model | Framing](#model)
- [Inputs](#inputs)

## Model (Framing)
- Why? design a process for aggregation, collaboration, and consumption
- How? Reversal (rearranged?) entropic flow via dialogue. 

- Old Model: Curate People (Inputs) => Human Thoughts / Words (Generated) => AI Sorting (Compute) => Human Attentional Sorting (Percieve)
- New Model (WIP): Human Conjures gpt-3 (Will) => AI Sorting (Computation) => AI Thoughts (Generated) => Group Curates (Outputs)

- Abstract: Input + Computation + Output => Concrete: twitter + gpt-3 + substack

Question: Should our default not always be debugging? Reasoning towards new commons grounds? Does tradition keep us bound or free us?
Question: How does memory play a role in our ecological space of normative psychology?
