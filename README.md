> An awesome list of gpt-3 experiments + outputted newsletter.

* Protoype: New interaction affordances for simulation exploration i.e. knowledge, wisdom, understanding, etc. 
* Goal: Reveal new structure in dialogue experiments to discern more actionable insight for new civilization vistas & surfaces. 
* Approach: Learning a path in a sequence of transitions via timely newsletter (email being a simple accessible interface, could emerge into something more [interactive](https://github.com/moskalyk/massively-multiplater-online-chat). 
* Analog: Joining twitter, curating twitter account following, and consuming feed leading to new language, values, orientations, for those deviating from typical normalized binary planes. Might be seen as a multidimensional politcal walk re: [Horseshoe Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory)

- [Inputs](#inputs)

## Model (Framing)
- Why? design a process for aggregation, collaboration, and consumption
- How? Reversal (rearranged?) entropic flow via dialogue. 

- Old Model: Curate People (Inputs) => Human Thoughts / Words (Generated) => AI Sorting (Compute) => Human Attentional Sorting (Percieve)
- New Model (WIP): Human Conjures gpt-3 (Will) => AI Sorting (Computation) => AI Thoughts (Generated) => Group Curates (Outputs)

- Abstract: Input + Computation + Output => Concrete: twitter + gpt-3 + substack 

> "I can easily see many jobs in the next 10-20 years changing their workflow to "human describes, AI builds, human debugs". - [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1284185128768503808)

Question: Should our default not always be debugging? Reasoning towards new commons grounds? Does tradition keep us bound or free us?
Question: How does memory & language play a role in our ecological space of normative psychology?
