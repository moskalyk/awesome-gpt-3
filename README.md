# awesome-gpt-3
An awesome list of gpt-3 experiments + outputted newsletter. Find it here: https://deep6.substack.com/p/coming-soon

Protoype: New interaction affordances for simulation detection i.e. knowledge, wisdom, etc.
Goal: Reveal new structure in dialogue experiements to discern more actionable insight for new vistas & surfaces.
Counter: Optical language flow funnelled attention into techno-slavery. 
Approach: Learning a path in a sequence of transitions via timely newsletter. 
Analog: Curated twitter account following and feed consumption.

Action Space: 
- Discrete Thoughts (e.g. tweet)
- Create Pull Request
- Consume Filtered Aggregation

# Model (Framing)
Why? design a process for aggregation, collaboration, and consumption
How? Reversal (rearranged?) of entropic flow via dialogue. 

Old Model: Curate People (Inputs) => Human Thoughts / Words (Generated) => AI Sorting (Compute) => Human Attentional Sorting (Percieve)
New Model (WIP): Human Conjures gpt-3 (Will) => AI Sorting (Computation) => AI Thoughts (Generated) => Group Curates (Outputs)

Abstract: Input + Computation + Output => Concrete: twitter + gpt-3 + substack 

"I can easily see many jobs in the next 10-20 years changing their workflow to "human describes, AI builds, human debugs". - [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1284185128768503808)

Question: Should our default not always be debugging? Reasoning towards new commons grounds? Does tradition keep us bound or free us?
Question: How does memory play a role in our ecological space of normative psychology?
